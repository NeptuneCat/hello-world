# hello-world
First repository. For ideas.

A bit about myself. I am a computer gamer. I decided when I was 11 that I wanted to be a computer programmer when I grew up. My brother and I had ideas to make an MMO together. Within a year I had changed my mind and thought that I instead would be a genetic therapist. Instead, I'm a Metallurgical Engineer. At work I am helping to create a website. I wrote the script (HTML, CSS, and a small amount of jQuery) in Notepad++. My current hobbies include gaming, crochet, knitting, caring for my husband and cat, and learning to code. I would still love to learn to program games and make one with my brother who is majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
